            In many villages, when young women continue their education after 12th, get a high paying job, or choose her
            own life partner, it becomes news.
            We are making rural women’s social & financial freedom a norm, not news.

            Through our district centric Kaabil Kamau Kamyaab campaigns, we’re sparking a cultural shift.
            By bringing together allies — government, businesses, young women & their communities — we create pathways
            for rural women to learn, earn, and excel in the modern world.
            As much as learning & earning of one Sapnewaali matters to us, so does the change in the way their villages
            and broader society treats them.

        <h3>Launching Careers, Not Livelihoods - Method of Change! </h3>
        <p>
            Sapna Centers, our unique rural college model, offers year+ long mini-MBA training to young rural women.
            Our pedagogy thrives on contextual content that has global applications!
            With their training at Sapne Centres, Sapnewaalis learn to thrive in domains where their entry is not even
            imagined right now.
            They help progressive organizations grow by becoming confident professionals in profiles of operations,
            facilitation, field research, communications among others.
            Sajhe Sapne's rural college model solves the limitations of livelihood training for young rural women with
            its focus on career growth pathways and a visible increase in skill, salary and social circle over the
            years.
            We are determined to shift the narrative from livelihoods to career growth pathways for young rural women
            coming from Dalit, Bahujan and Adivasi communities.

        <h3>Sapnewaalis Figuring it Out - Stories of Change! Heading</h3>
        <p>
            Sapnewaali Alisha, whose marriage was arranged at 2, joined our year long program as a new obedient bride at
            18 making sure her head was always covered with a dupatta.
            She had joined the program fully convinced she'd never get a job.
            Alisha became the first in our inaugural cohort to turn her internship into a Communications Associate role.
            When we shared the news the Sapnewaalis cheered, lifting her into the air. Her dupatta slipped from her head
            for the first time in six months — a sight I had never seen before.
            That moment was pure magic. And we get to witness many such powerful moments with Sapnewaalis’ each life and
            career milestone.
